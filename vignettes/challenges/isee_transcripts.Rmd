abstract: |
  The primary aim of this project is to allow for transcript-level visualizations in the `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("iSEE")` framework.
  The expected deliverables are two or three new panels to the `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("iSEE")` interface.
  These panels should provide users with relevant insights at the level of individual isoforms. 
  By extension, this challenge can be seen a single application within the larger effort of unlocking `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("iSEE")` for data with multiple modes.
