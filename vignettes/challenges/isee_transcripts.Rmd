abstract: |
  The primary aim of this project is to allow for transcript-level
  visualizations in the iSEE framework. The expected deliverables are
  two or three new panels to the iSEE interface. These panels should provide 
  the user with relevant insights at the level of individual isoforms. 
  By extension, this challenge can be seen a single application within 
  the larger effort of unlocking iSEE for data with multiple modes.
