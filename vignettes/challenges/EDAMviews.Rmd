abstract: |
  The [EDAM ontology](https://github.com/edamontology/edamontology) should be useful
  for improving the organization of Bioconductor resources.  This challenge considers how
  to integrate information in the ontology with biocViews terms.  It may be possible to
  reconceptualize the role of biocViews in project infrastructure in the context of this
  challenge.

## Guidelines

### Note

This task can impact several aspects of Bioconductor and R packages for
genomics.  

- First, use of [EDAM](https://github.com/edamontology/edamontology)
to tag Bioconductor packages and resources may aid in the processes of publicizing and discovering
software and data
- Second, an EDAMviews tag may be added as an endorsed field for package DESCRIPTION
- Third, EDAM may integrate into the presentation of Bioconductor resources in the same
manner as biocViews does presently; see the [search box for software](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/BiocViews.html#___Software).


### Evaluate EDAM and compare to biocViews

Investigate the biocViews vocabulary, and the EDAM ontology.  For motivation, consider the display
derived from [the EDAM browser](https://edamontology.github.io/edam-browser/#operation_0533):

<p>
<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/bioc-anvil-images/EDAM.png" alt="" width="800" />
<p>

How can we take advantage of this terminology and concept structure?

- Are there terms in biocViews for which EDAM terms are ready-to-use substitutes?
- Are there concepts in biocViews that are lacking in EDAM that should be proposed for additions?
