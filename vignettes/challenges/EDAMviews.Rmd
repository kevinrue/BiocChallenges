abstract: |
  The [EDAM ontology](https://github.com/edamontology/edamontology) should be useful
  for improving the organization of Bioconductor resources.  This challenge considers how
  to integrate information in the ontology with biocViews terms.  It may be possible to
  reconceptualize the role of biocViews in project infrastructure in the context of this
  challenge.

## Guidelines

Investigate the biocViews vocabulary, and the EDAM ontology.  For motivation, consider the display:

How can we take advantage of this terminology and concept structure?
