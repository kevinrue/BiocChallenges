## Guidelines

Fork the original repository <i class="fab fa-github"></i> `r BiocStyle::Githubpkg("LTLA/SCEGallery")`, working on a branch of your fork, and submitting a pull request when your contribution is ready for review.

You may contribute new R markdown files or edit existing ones.

When contributing a new chapter, we recommend reading an [existing chapter](https://github.com/LTLA/SCEGallery/blob/master/reduced-dimensions.Rmd), and using it as a template for your own contribution.

Contributions written in a style that matches current contents are more likely to be accepted, and more rapidly.
