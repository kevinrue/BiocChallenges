abstract: |
  The main aim of this challenge is to compile useful functionality to 
  assist package developers in finding the underlying cause for package 
  build failures, e.g., on the Bioconductor build machines. A package may 
  fail to build because of errors introduced in the package itself, but 
  given the strong interdependencies among Bioconductor packages, the 
  underlying reason can also be changes introduced in another package.
