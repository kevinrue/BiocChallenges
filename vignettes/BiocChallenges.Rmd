# Welcome

The goal of <i class="fab fa-github"></i> `r BiocStyle::Githubpkg("kevinrue/BiocChallenges")` is to host challenges contributed by and for the Bioconductor community.

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(BiocChallenges)
```

# Challenge difficulty

Each challenge is accompanied by an estimated difficulty.
The difficulty level can be one of:

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
cat(sprintf("- `%s`", BiocChallenges::difficulty_levels), sep = "\n")
```

# Topics

Each challenge is tagged by a list of topic labels to facilitate categorization and discoverability.
Topic tags can be any combination of:

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
cat(sprintf("- `%s`", BiocChallenges::topic_tags), sep = "\n")
```

New topics can be submitted as [pull requests](https://github.com/kevinrue/BiocChallenges/pulls) editing the [topics.R](https://github.com/kevinrue/BiocChallenges/blob/main/R/topics.R) script.
