## Guidelines

Fork the original repository <i class="fab fa-github"></i> `r BiocStyle::Githubpkg("kevinrue/BiocChallenges2", "BiocChallenges")`, working on a branch of your fork, and submitting a pull request when your contribution is ready for review.

New functionality should contribute to the experience of both challenge leaders and contributors.

Unit tests should be provided, where possible.

Contributions written in a style that matches current contents are more likely to be accepted, and more rapidly.
